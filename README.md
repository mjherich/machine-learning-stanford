# Machine Learning - Stanford #
Taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

I took this course to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts and best practices. I hope to use the knowledge gained in this course to implement market segmentation and a rudimentary article spinner.
